# **Reactfolio - Portfolio Projects Page** 🚀

## 📌 **Overview**
**Reactfolio** is a sleek and interactive **React-based portfolio projects page** designed to showcase development work in a visually engaging way. Built with **React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, and Framer Motion**, it provides a dynamic and responsive interface with smooth animations and dark mode support.

## 🎨 **Features**
- 🔥 **Dynamic Project Cards** – Showcases projects with images, descriptions, and technology logos.
- 🎭 **Interactive Animations** – Smooth transitions, hover effects, and glowing red highlights using **Framer Motion**.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Support** – Fully styled for both light and dark themes.
- 📱 **Responsive Grid Layout** – Adapts seamlessly across all devices with a two-column layout on larger screens.
- 🛠 **Technology Stack Icons** – Displays project technologies using logos.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- ⚛ **React** (Functional Components, Hooks)
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS & DaisyUI** (For Styling & UI Components)
- 🎞 **Framer Motion** (Animations & Transitions)
- 🖼 **React Icons** (Icons for UI Enhancement)
